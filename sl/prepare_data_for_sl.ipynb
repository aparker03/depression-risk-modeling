    "# Preparing Data for Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates a version of `merged_clean.csv` specifically prepared for supervised modeling. The output file is saved as `merged_clean_sl.csv` in the `data/clean/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recoded yes/no fields into binary values\n",
    "- Converted insurance coverage variables to binary flags\n",
    "- Dropped columns that were completely missing\n",
    "- Recoded gender for modeling use\n",
    "- Converted relevant columns from float to integer (e.g., binary, ordinal, and count-based fields like age and household size)\n",
    "\n",
    "This version avoids one-hot encoding and keeps variables in a format that supports model interpretability while maintaining a clean structure for training classifiers or regressors.\n"
